<h1>The Fatal Flaw: Exploiting the TCP Three-Way Handshake</h1>
<p>&nbsp;The SYN flood attack is a classic demonstration of exploiting a fundamental, necessary mechanism of the Internet: the TCP Three-Way Handshake. To fully appreciate the attack, one must understand the standard connection process first.</p>
<p>The Standard Connection Choreography</p>
<p>For a reliable connection to be established between a client and a server, TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) requires a three-step exchange.</p>
<ol start="1">
	<li>
		<p><b>SYN (Synchronize):</b> A client sends a <code>SYN</code> packet to the server, initiating the desire to communicate.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p><b>SYN-ACK (Synchronize-Acknowledge):</b> The server receives the request, sends a <code>SYN-ACK</code> back to the client, and critically, <b>it allocates resources</b> for the prospective connection. This includes space in a <b>backlog queue</b> and memory for connection state information. At this point, the connection is in a <b>"half-open" state</b>.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p><b>ACK (Acknowledge):</b> The client sends a final <code>ACK</code> packet, confirming the receipt of the server's acknowledgment. The connection is now <b>established</b>, and data transfer can begin.</p>
	</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<h3><b>The Attack: Flooding the Backlog Queue</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p>The SYN flood attack specifically targets step 2, the resource allocation phase. The attacker sends a massive volume of initial <code>SYN</code> packets but deliberately <b>never sends the final <code>ACK</code></b>.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3></h3>
<p></p>
<p>This is often achieved by <b>IP address spoofing</b>, where the attacker disguises the source IP address of the <code>SYN</code> packets. When the target server sends its <code>SYN-ACK</code> response, it goes to a non-existent or unreachable address. Because there is no legitimate client to complete the connection, the half-open connection sits dormant, consuming the allocated resources in the server's backlog queue.</p>
<p>Consequence: Resource Exhaustion and Denial of Service (DoS)</p>
<p>Server operating systems maintain a finite-sized data structure (the backlog queue) to track these half-open connection requests. As the attacker continues to send thousands of incomplete SYN packets, this queue quickly becomes saturated as there are too many null processes memory has to handle.</p>
<p>Once the backlog queue is full, the server is physically unable to allocate resources for any new or incoming connection attempts. Any subsequent SYN packets, even those coming from legitimate sources or users, are simply dropped. The server remains online, but its capacity to accept new connections is completely choked. Legitimate sessions time out, critical services degrade, and the target ultimately crashes at some point, is effectively taken offline, thus achieving the primary goal of the Denial of Service (DoS) attack.</p>
