<h1>What is Implicit Deny?</h1>
<p><span style="font-family: Poppins;">Access Control Lists (ACLs) are fundamental security features in Cisco routers that provide powerful packet filtering capabilities. These ordered lists of rules examine incoming and outgoing network traffic based on specific criteria, allowing administrators to control and filter traffic according yo predefined policies.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #674ea7; font-family: Poppins; font-weight: normal;">║</span><span style="font-family: Poppins; font-weight: normal;">Implicit Deny</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-family: Poppins;">A critical concept in ACLs is the <strong>Implicit Deny</strong> rule. This rule operates as an unspoken final command that denies all traffic not explicitly allowed by the preceding rules. In Cisco ACL configurations, while this rule is not visible in the configuration, it is always active. The presence of Implicit Deny ensures that traffic is allowed only if it matches specified rules, effectively implementing a whitelist approach.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Poppins;">For example:</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext"><span style="font-size: medium;">permit ip 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 any
permit tcp any 10.0.0.0 0.0.0.255 eq 80
</span></code></pre>
<p><span style="font-family: Poppins;">Any traffic that does not match the above rules will be denied because of the implicit deny at the end of the list.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #674ea7; font-family: Poppins; font-weight: normal;">║</span><span style="font-family: Poppins; font-weight: normal;">Deny Any Any Rule</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-family: Poppins;">The <strong>Deny any any</strong> command is a variation of the implicit deny. This rule explicitly specifies that any packet not matching a prior rule is denied. It is often included at the end of ACLs for clarity and logging purposes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Poppins;">In <strong>Extended ACLs</strong>, where traffic filtering involves both source and destination IPs and other attributes, the Deny any any rule includes the keyword "any" twice, covering all traffic from any source to any destination. For example:</span></p>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext"><span style="font-size: medium;">deny ip any any
</span></code></pre>
<p><span style="font-family: Poppins;">This command ensures no unintended traffic slips through.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #674ea7; font-family: Poppins; font-weight: normal;">║</span><span style="font-family: Poppins; font-weight: normal;">Key Differences Between Implicit Deny and Deny Any Any:</span></h2>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-family: Poppins;"><strong>Implicit Deny</strong>: Always present by default but not displayed in the configuration.<br /><br /></span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: Poppins;"><strong>Deny Any Any</strong>: Explicitly configured by the administrator, often used for logging and troubleshooting to document dropped traffic.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-family: Poppins;">By leveraging these mechanisms, administrators can tightly control network access, safeguarding against unauthorized use while maintaining operational clarity.</span></p>
