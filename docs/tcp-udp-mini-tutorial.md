## Transmission Control Protocol
<p>TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol)are two protocols that are used for sending data over the internet. TCP is a connection-oriented protocol that provides reliable data transfer and error checking mechanisms. UDP is a connectionless protocol that does not provide any reliability or error checking mechanisms.</p>
<p>TCP and UDP use ports to identify the applications that are sending or receiving data. A port is a 16-bit number that is used to identify a specific process to which the data is being sent. TCP and UDP use different port ranges. TCP uses ports from 0 to 65535, while UDP uses ports from 0 to 65535.</p>
<p>TCP is used for applications that require reliable data transfer, such as email, file transfer, and web browsing. UDP is used for applications that require fast data transfer, such as video streaming and online gaming.</p>
<h2>Examples of Applications That Use TCP</h2>
<p>TCP is used extensively by many internet applications, including the World Wide Web (WWW), email, File Transfer Protocol (FTP), Secure Shell (SSH), peer-to-peer file sharing, and streaming media. Some other examples of well-known applications that use TCP include Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), and Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) itself.</p>
<h2>Examples of Applications That Use UDP</h2>
<p>Numerous key Internet applications use UDP, including the Domain Name System (DNS), the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP), the Routing Information Protocol (RIP), and the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)1. Streaming media applications such as IPTV, online radio, and video conferencing use UDP to transmit real-time audio and video data2. Voice and video traffic is generally transmitted using UDP1. Other examples of applications that use UDP include tunneling/VPN, media streaming, games that don&rsquo;t care if you get every update, and local broadcast mechanisms.</p>
<h2>Difference Between TCP and UDP</h2>
<p>TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) are both transport layer protocols used for communication between network devices. The main difference between TCP and UDP is that TCP provides reliable data transmission while UDP does not. TCP is connection-oriented, which means that it establishes a connection before data transmission begins and ensures that all packets are delivered in order and without errors. On the other hand, UDP is connectionless, which means that it does not establish a connection before data transmission begins and does not guarantee packet delivery or order.</p>
<h2>Purpose of UDP</h2>
<p>UDP is used for applications that require fast, efficient transmission of data but do not require the reliability of TCP. It is often used for real-time applications such as video conferencing, online gaming, and voice over IP (VoIP) because it can transmit data quickly without the overhead of error checking and retransmission.</p>
<h2>Purpose of TCP</h2>
<p>TCP is used for applications that require reliable data transmission. It provides error checking and retransmission of lost packets to ensure that all data is delivered correctly and in order. TCP is often used for applications such as email, file transfer, and web browsing where data integrity is important.</p>
<h2>Common TCP Ports</h2>
<p>There are many common port numbers for TCP. Some of the most commonly used ports include:</p>
<ul>
<li>FTP (File Transfer Protocol) - 20/21</li>
<li>SSH (Secure Shell) - 22</li>
<li>Telnet - 23</li>
<li>SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) - 25</li>
<li>HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) - 80</li>
<li>POP3 (Post Office Protocol version 3) - 110</li>
<li>IMAP4 (Internet Message Access Protocol version 4) - 143</li>
<li>HTTPS (HTTP Secure) - 443</li>
</ul>
<p>This is just a small sample of the many TCP ports that are in use.</p>
<h2>Common UDP Ports</h2>
<p>Some of the most common UDP ports include:</p>
<ul>
<li>DNS (Domain Name System) - 53</li>
<li>DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) - 67/68</li>
<li>TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol) - 69</li>
- SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) - 161/162
<li>NTP (Network Time Protocol) - 123</li>
</ul>
<p>This is just a small sample of the many UDP ports that are in use.</p>
<h2>How TCP and UDP Protocols Help Us in Every Day Tasks</h2>
<p>TCP and UDP are both protocols used for sending data over the internet. TCP is a connection-oriented protocol that provides reliable and ordered delivery of data between applications. It is used for applications that require high reliability, such as email, file transfer, and web browsing. UDP is a connectionless protocol that provides unreliable delivery of data between applications. It is used for applications that require low latency and can tolerate some data loss, such as video streaming and online gaming1.</p>
<p>In everyday life, you might use TCP when you send an email or browse the web. You might use UDP when you stream video or play an online game.</p>
<h2>What the Internet Would Be Like Without TCP and UDP</h2>
<p>Without TCP and UDP protocols, the internet would not exist as we know it today. These protocols are essential for transmitting data over the internet. TCP provides reliable delivery of data between applications, while UDP provides low-latency delivery of data between applications.</p>
<p>The internet would be much slower and less reliable without these protocols. It would be difficult to send emails, browse the web, or stream video without them.</p>
<h2>Alternative Protocols That Could Make the Internet Work if TCP and UDP Did Not Exist</h2>
<p>TCP and UDP are the most commonly used protocols for transmitting data over the internet. Without these protocols, the internet would not exist as we know it today; however, there are other protocols that could be used to transmit data over the internet if TCP and UDP were not available.</p>
<p>One such protocol is the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP), which is used for diagnostic and error messages. Another protocol is the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP), which is used to map IP addresses to MAC addresses1.</p>
<p>However, these protocols are not designed for transmitting data between applications like TCP and UDP are. Without TCP and UDP, it would be difficult to send emails, browse the web, or stream video.</p>
<h2>How TCP/IP Was Created</h2>
<p>The TCP/IP protocol suite was created in the 1970s by two DARPA scientists, Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn. They are known as the &ldquo;Fathers of the Internet&rdquo; in computer history.</p>
<h2>How UDP Was Created</h2>
<p>The User Datagram Protocol (UDP) was designed by David P. Reed in 1980 and formally defined in RFC 7681.</p>
