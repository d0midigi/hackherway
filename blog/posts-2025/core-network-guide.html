  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <h3>So, what the heck is a Network?</h3>
  <p>
    A network consists of two or more computers that are linked in order to share resources. Computer networks are the basis of communication in IT. They are used in a huge variety of ways and can include many different types of network. A computer network is a set of computers that are connected together so that they can share information. The earliest examples of computer networks are from the 1960s, but they have come a long way in the half-century since then.

  <div class="center mini">LAN Network Topology - SOHO / Small Home Network</div>
  <p><strong>Two very common types of networks include: LAN (Local Area Network) and WAN (Wide Area Network)</strong></p>

  <h3>Topologies</h3>
  <h4>LAN - Local Area Network</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>A LAN is a network that has a logical and physical borders that a computer can broadcast</li>
  </ul>
  <div class="center"><img width="70%" src="https://www.geocities.ws/alcantara97/starhttt.gif" alt="LAN Topology"></div>

  <h4>WAN - Wide Area Network</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>WAN is a multiple LANs or additional WANs with routing functionality for interconnectivity.</li>
  </ul>
  <div class="center"><img width="70%" src="https://gist.github.com/Samsar4/62886aac358c3d484a0ec17e8eb11266/raw/a3f9b5f3f243467208da83e0d0e543b32233c5d6/wan-topo.jpg" alt="WAN Topology"></div>

  <h4>MAN - Metropolitan Area Network</h4>
  <div class="center"><img width="70%" src="https://gist.githubusercontent.com/Samsar4/62886aac358c3d484a0ec17e8eb11266/raw/f37cec4e00f726cb4be3661f20ccad77751e003a/man-topo.jpg" alt="MAN Topology"></div>

  <h4>Internet</h4>
  <p>Connecting WANs through WANs until complete the entire world = Internet.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The protocol which runs the internet is TCP/IP</li>
    <li>As long you're using legitimate IPv4 address or IPv6</li>
  </ul>
  <div class="center"><img width="70%" src="https://gist.githubusercontent.com/Samsar4/62886aac358c3d484a0ec17e8eb11266/raw/8c176b8a798fb5749c4391c45015ee5d14d56f13/internet.png" alt="Internet"></div>

  <h4>Intranet</h4>
  <p>If you're using the TCP/IP stack and making your own LAN or WAN = Intranet.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Intranet is a private network which still runs TCP/IP</li>
  </ul>
  <div class="center"><img width="70%" src="https://gist.githubusercontent.com/Samsar4/62886aac358c3d484a0ec17e8eb11266/raw/8c176b8a798fb5749c4391c45015ee5d14d56f13/intranet.png" alt="Intranet"></div>

  <h3>Common Terms in Networking</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><b>IP (internet protocol) address</b>: the network address of the system across the network, also known as the Logical Address.</li>
    <li><b>MAC address</b>: the MAC address or physical address uniquely identifies each host. It is associated with the Network Interface Card (NIC).</li>
    <li><b>Open system</b>: an open system is connected to the network and prepared for communication.</li>
    <li><b>Closed system</b>: a closed system is not connected to the network and so can't be communicated with.</li>
    <li><b>Port</b>: a port is a channel through which data is sent and received.</li>
    <li><b>Nodes</b>: nodes is a term used to refer to any computing devices such as computers that send and receive network packets across the network.</li>
    <li><b>Network packets</b>: the data that is sent to and from the nodes in a network.</li>
    <li><b>Routers</b>: routers are pieces of hardware that manage router packets. They determine which node the information came from and where to send it to. A router has a routing protocol which defines how it communicates with other routers.</li>
    <li><b>Network address translation (NAT)</b>: a technique that routers use to provide internet service to more devices using fewer public IPs. A router has a public IP address but devices connected to it are assigned private IPs that others outside of the network can't see.</li>
    <li><b>Dynamic host configuration protocol (DHCP)</b>: assigns dynamic IP addresses to hosts and is maintained by the internet service provider.</li>
    <li><b>Internet service providers (ISP)</b>: companies that provide everyone with their internet connection, both to individuals and to businesses and other organizations.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. IP &amp; MAC Address</h2>
  <h3>What is an IP Address (Internet Protocol)?</h3>
  <img src="https://media.fs.com/images/community/upload/wangEditor/201912/24/_1577182449_2uLs0pQcuT.jpg" alt="IP Address">
  <p>
    An IP address is a unique address that identifies a device on the internet or a local network. IP stands for "Internet Protocol," which is the set of rules governing the format of data sent via the internet or local network.
  </p>

  <h4>Check your local IP address</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>If you are using Linux or MacOS you can open your terminal and type <code>ifconfig</code> command</li>
    <li>For Windows machine you can open up the cmd prompt or powershell, then type <code>ipconfig /all</code></li>
  </ol>
  <img src="https://gist.githubusercontent.com/Samsar4/62886aac358c3d484a0ec17e8eb11266/raw/5a56240010acbc33026413ad6b5c6f66e9450413/inet.png" alt="inet output">

  <ul>
    <li>inet IPv4: <code>192.168.64.3</code> <br>
      - <b>inet</b> &rarr; The inet (Internet protocol family) shows the local IP address. This is IP version 4 (IPv4) Using 32-bit decimal number.
    </li>
    <li>inet6 IPv6: <code>fe80::c83b:ccff:fe0e:1069</code><br>
      - <b>inet6</b> &rarr; Is a new version of IP (IPv6), using 128 bits hexadecimal value.
    </li>
    <li><b>ether</b> &rarr; MAC address - unique identifier assigned to a network interface controller (NIC)</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>More about the IPv4 decimal value:</h4>
  <pre>IPv4 = 32 bits range (4 octets of 8 bits, from 0-255 each(4))

11000000.10101000.01000000.00000011   [IPv4 binary]
   192  .   168  .   64   .  3        [IPv4 decimal]
  </pre>

  <h4>The arithmetic behind IPv4:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>One octet have 8 bits:</li>
  </ul>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>0 or 1</th><th>0 or 1</th><th>0 or 1</th><th>0 or 1</th><th>0 or 1</th><th>0 or 1</th><th>0 or 1</th><th>0 or 1</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>8th bit</td><td>7th bit</td><td>6th bit</td><td>5th bit</td><td>4th bit</td><td>3rd bit</td><td>2nd bit</td><td>1st bit</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>128 (2^7)</td><td>64 (2^6)</td><td>32 (2^5)</td><td>16 (2^4)</td><td>8 (2^3)</td><td>4 (2^2)</td><td>2 (2^1)</td><td>1 (2^0)</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>
    Here is how binary octets convert to decimal: The right most bit, or least significant bit, of an octet holds a value of 2<sup>0</sup>. The bit just to the left of that holds a value of 2<sup>1</sup>. This continues until the left-most bit, or most significant bit, which holds a value of 2<sup>7</sup>. So if all binary bits are a one, the decimal equivalent would be 255 as shown here:
  </p>
  <pre>
  1   1   1   1   1   1   1   1
  |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
(128 +64 +32 +16 +8  +4  +2  +1) --> 255 
</pre>
  <p>
    Example of octet conversion:<br>
    IP Address: <code>192.168.64.3</code><br>
    To calculate the first octet (192.), from binary format to decimal:
  </p>
  <pre>
128  64  32  16  8   4   2   1         
 |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
 1   1   0   0   0   0   0   0          
 |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
128+ 64+ 0+  0+  0+  0+  0+  0 = 192   ---> final value (firt octet IPv4 in decimal)
</pre>
  <ul>
    <li>Take the IP: <code>192.168.64.3</code></li>
    <li>The first octet <code>192</code> in 8-bit binary is <code>11000000</code>.</li>
    <li>Only the 8th and 7th bit is on and the rest of them (6th to 1st bit) is off, meaning the decimal value is the final sum of these values: 128 + 64 = 192</li>
  </ul>
  <div class="warn">⚠️ Why? Computers see everything in terms of binary: on and off.</div>

  <h4>IPv4 and IPv6</h4>
  <img src="https://academy.avast.com/hs-fs/hubfs/New_Avast_Academy/IPv4%20vs.%20IPv6%20What%E2%80%99s%20the%20Difference/IPv4-vs-IPv6.png?width=2750&name=IPv4-vs-IPv6.png" alt="IPv4 vs IPv6">

  <h4>Private and Public IP Addresses</h4>
  <p>
    All IPv4 addresses can be divided into two major groups: <strong>global (or public, external)</strong> - this group can also be called 'WAN addresses' — those that are used on the Internet, and <strong>private (or local, internal) addresses</strong> — those that are used in the local network (LAN).
  </p>
  <img src="https://wiki.teltonika-networks.com/wikibase/images/thumb/a/a7/Sip.png/1100px-Sip.png" alt="Public vs Private IP">

  <h4>More about <strong>Private IP</strong> addresses:</h4>
  <p>
    Private (internal) addresses are not routed on the Internet and no traffic can be sent to them from the Internet, they only supposed to work within the local network.
    Private addresses include IP addresses from the following subnets:

  <h4>NAT - Network Address Translation</h4>
  <p>
    NAT stands for network address translation. It’s a way to map multiple local private addresses to a public one before transferring the information. Organizations that want multiple devices to employ a single IP address use NAT, as do most home routers. 
  </p>
  <img src="https://gist.githubusercontent.com/Samsar4/62886aac358c3d484a0ec17e8eb11266/raw/8275f73b57bdcb982b1d69aa8d213d2bdb384657/nat2.png" alt="NAT">
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Static NAT</strong>
      <br>When the local address is converted to a public one, this NAT chooses the same one. This means there will be a consistent public IP address associated with that router or NAT device.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Dynamic NAT</strong>
      <br>Instead of choosing the same IP address every time, this NAT goes through a pool of public IP addresses. This results in the router or NAT device getting a different address each time the router translates the local address to a public address.
    </li>
  </ol>
